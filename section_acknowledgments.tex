We warmly thank our colleagues from the WFIRST Project Office and all the Science Investigation Teams for continuous constructive and stimulating interactions. We acknowledge use of the Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics LaTeX template as a basis for our report. Part of this research was carried out at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. The decision to implement the WFIRST mission will not be finalized until NASA's completion of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process.
