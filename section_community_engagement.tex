The coming decade will be an exciting time for cosmology. Before WFIRST launch,  major cosmological imaging surveys (KiDS, HSC, DES) and the DESI and PFS spectroscopic surveys will significantly advance our current understanding. WFIRST, Euclid and LSST  will then go further and survey the sky at optical and infrared wavelengths, the  James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Extremely Large Telescopes (ELTs) will make very deep maps of the sky; eROSITA will survey the X-ray sky; CMB-S4 will make a deep map of the millimeter sky; and the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) and other radio surveys will map the large-scale distribution of H$\,${\sc i}.

%Our team will explore ways of maximizing the science return from these combined data sets. Our team members are playing significant roles in a number of these projects and have good ties to the other major surveys.

One goal of our SIT is to determine the analysis infrastructure and observations needed to achieve the full potential of WFIRST in combination with these  surveys. This is best done through a broad community effort that brings together scientists from these complementary projects. Our SIT team is well-placed to do this, through team members' significant roles in a number of these projects and ties to the other major surveys.

We started to actively engage the community to identify and pursue the key areas where WFIRST and the concurrent projects will provide new opportunities to mitigate systematics and enhance the combined cosmological science return. We started a series of open workshops to study the interplay between major planned surveys and WFIRST into the WFIRST strategy, to identify: (i) pre-launch observations, (ii) how these external data sets affect the WFIRST observing strategy (e.g., deep fields) and the instrument, and (iii) the software needed (to be built post-CDR) for combining these data sets.

The first of this meeting happened in Pasadena on September 2016. It was focused on the synergies between the WFIRST HLS Cosmology SIT and LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC), both at the science level but also at the implementation level. The meeting was co-organized by Rachel Bean, Olivier Dor\'e, Steve Kahn and Jason Rhodes and was attended by about 60 scientists from the two collaborations. The slides are available \href{https://conference.ipac.caltech.edu/wfirst_lsst/}{here} and pictures can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:pic_workshop}. The conclusion of the workshop will be summarized in a white paper to be written shortly.

The workshop was built on the premise that \emph{The Whole is Greater than the
Sum of the Parts: Optimizing the Joint Science Return from LSST, Euclid and
WFIRST} articulated in \citet{Jain:2015cpa}. In the conclusion of this community
white paper, it was articulated that the scientific opportunity offered by the
combination of data from LSST and WFIRST (and Euclid) goes well beyond the
science enabled by any one of the data sets alone. The range in wavelength,
angular resolution and redshift coverage that these missions jointly span is
remarkable. With major investments in LSST and WFIRST (and partnership with ESA
in Euclid), the US has an outstanding scientific opportunity to carry out a
combined analysis of these data sets. It is imperative for us to seize it and,
together with our European colleagues, prepare for the defining cosmological
pursuit of the 21st century.

As illustrated already in \S~\ref{sec:forecast}, the coming decade will be the era of multi-probes/multi-survey science. The richer insights will come from combining multiple probes (WL, GRS, GC) \emph{reliably}. If done properly, multiple survey joint analysis will enable new calibration schemes (photo-$z$, intrinsic alignment models, etc.) and new control of systematics (PSF effects, contaminant control such as stars or interlopers).

The main argument for conducting a single, high-quality reference co-analysis exercise and carefully documenting the results is the complexity and subtlety of systematics that define this co-analysis. Falling back on many small efforts by different teams in selected fields and for narrow goals will be inefficient, leading to significant duplication of effort.  For much of the science, we will need to combine the photometry across multiple wavelengths with varying spectral and spatial resolution – a technical challenge. The joint analysis can be carried out in ways that have different computational demands. The most technically demanding joint analysis is to work with pixel level data of the entire area of overlap between the surveys. Many of the goals of a joint analysis require such a pixel-level analysis. If pixel-level joint analysis is not feasible, catalog-level analysis can still be beneficial, say to obtain calibrations of the lensing shear or the redshift distribution of galaxies. Hybrid efforts are also potentially useful, for example using catalog level information from space for deblending LSST galaxies, or using only a mutually agreed subset of the data for calibration purposes. However the full benefits of jointly analyzing any two of the surveys can be reaped only through pixel-level analysis.

\paragraph{Joint Analysis} In the workshop, possible algorithmic implementation of a joint analysis pipeline were discussed independently by Peter Melchior and Michael Schneider. \citet{Melchior:2016asy} motivated the need for complex morphology models and developed the relevant statistical framework. Complex models become norm. They are more flexible and properly behaved. WFIRST benefits from LSST through color-morphology priors. LSST benefits from sharp likelihood peaks in WFIRST bands. LSST benefits from WFIRST through superior resolution. In HLS directly from a segmentation posterior, otherwise from a prior. \citet{Schneider:2014rha} have developed a probabilistic image reduction pipeline (forward modeling) motivated by challenges in multi-epoch/multi-telescope combinations. They demonstrated improved shear measurements for LSST in the HST Frontier field. 

\paragraph{Ressources} The resources required to achieve this additional science are outside of what is currently budgeted for LSST by NSF and DOE, and for WFIRST (or Euclid) by NASA. Funding for this science would most naturally emerge from coordination among all agencies involved, and would be closely orchestrated scientifically and programmatically to optimize science returns. A possible model would be to identify members of the science teams of each project who would work together on the joint analysis. The analysis team would ideally be coupled with an experienced science center acting as a focal point for the implementation, and simultaneously preparing the public release and documentation for broadest access by the community.

How can we best take advantage of/combine the efforts from LSST + WFIRST groups working on simulation tools? Photo-z methods?
Communicate and share codes.

What are the requirements for LSST + WFIRST photo-z performance? Or, conversely, what information on photo-z performance do analysis groups need in order to forecast their cosmology constraints and develop pipelines?
More studies are needed.

How do we work together to maximize utility/minimize duplication in spectroscopic samples?
Capak et al. are building a public calibration catalog for WFIRST and LSST.

Relevant also for deep surveys synchronization, discussed in this context and others (SNe, shape cal., grism cal., GO).

Large efforts under way in LSST (DESC) with multiple planned data challenges.
Computational needs:
 Resources available for the scale of simulations required (with possible exception of hydrodynamical simulations).
Infrastructure needs:
Sharing simulations (e.g. Millennium DB) and mock catalogs has greatly  expanded the use of simulations in a broad range of applications.
A 100 TB to 1 PB scale infrastructure doesn’t exist.
Data transfer will be a challenge (10 days for 100 TB at 1 Gb).
Opportunity for collaborations and investments.
Mock catalogs:
Great progress in the development of mocks from SHAMs, SAMs, hydro
No next generation mock catalogs (or agreement on attributes or what they mean) yet.

Joint analysis will target specific science goals in DE or other areas.  A common-use data legacy from co-processing gets to the science faster and amplifies pay-off well beyond targeted science papers:
Well-designed, well-documented public-release products are best use of limited resources.
They attract new users, enable more science.
Science center expertise can help generate and preserve them efficiently, along with tools, docs, ancillary data, simulations, etc.
“Processing tiers” are one example of resource usage tuned for maximizing the science:
Existing expertise at centers and projects is more than adequate.
This plan is agnostic as to who does what.
Centers and projects do lower tiers, community competes for science exploitation
U.S. agencies and community should be aware of similar planning in Europe, leave open a path to collaboration, but avoid being left behind.
As an aside, LSST project (R. Dubois) estimates that processing WFIRST in the same framework would require ~30-40% additional resources (maybe of by a factor of a few).


Themes we have identified for these multi-experiment workshops include: (i) Statistical methods for next generation cosmological analyses (ii) Strong lensing: synergies between ground and space (iii) Photometric redshift accuracy for next generation surveys (iv) LSST and WFIRST: data simulations and joint analyses to tackle systematics and reveal the dark sector.


Furthermore, through our team's international scientists in Canada and Japan, we plan to also engage these communities in WFIRST science.  If these  countries become partners, we hope that our international co-Investigators will receive support from their agencies and that they will serve as points of contact with their scientific communities and with the CHIME project (Smith) and the Subaru HSC/PFS project (Takada/Yoshida).
