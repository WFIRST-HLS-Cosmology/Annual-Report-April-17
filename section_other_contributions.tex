\subsection{\emph{Princeton Meetings} Participation}
%---------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to the active participation by the SIT leads to the 4 FSWG meetings that happened this year, team members participated to two focused so-called \emph{Princeton Meetings} meetings organized by Prof. Spergel in Princeton University and at the newly established Flatiron Institute in  New York, NY. These two meetings were focused respectively on planning the data processing need of the WFI given our collective experience with large astronomical datasets data processing, and ancillary science enabled by the HLS. Team members Lupton, Mandelbaum, Samushia, van der Linden represented our SIT at this meeting and presented their thoughts on these topics.

\subsection{Contributions to Evaluation of the WFIRST Supernova Program}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to our work on the HLS cosmology surveys,
team members Olivier Dor\'e, Chris Hirata, David Spergel,
and David Weinberg all contributed to evaluating strategies and
requirements for the WFIRST supernova program, providing a
sounding board for the two supernova SITs and synthesizing
information for project management.  Some of these contributions
took place in sessions of the WFIRST FSWG meetings and some
of it in telecons and email exchanges with members of the
supernova teams.  Weinberg wrote an extensive referee report
for the Hounsell et al.\ paper (from the supernova SIT led by
Ryan Foley) on WFIRST supernova strategies.  Most importantly,
all four investigators participated in the ``supernova summit''
held at KIPAC in March 2017, reading background material from
the teams, participating in a day of presentations and discussions,
and writing a report for project management and the supernova SITs.


\subsection{Supported Postdoctoral Researchers and Graduate Students}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------

Our team has been very proactive at leveraging our collective involvement in other on-going large scale observational efforts such as the Dark Energy Survey (DES), the SUBARU Hyper-Suprime Cam (HSC) survey, but also the joint ESA/NASA Euclid mission and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope Dark Energy Science Collaboration (LSST DESC) to create joint appointments and assemble a team of very strong postdoctoral researchers. In particular, the following researchers joined our team and are partially supported by out SIT:
\begin{itemize}
\item Ivano Baronchelli (Caltech/IPAC), working with Harry Teplitz on updating measurements of the H$\alpha$ luminosity function using HST data;

\item Hao-Yi "Heidi" Wu (OSU), working with Chris Hirata and David Weinberg on simulations for the galaxy cluster investigation (starting in fall 2017).
\end{itemize}

In addition, Arun Kannawadi, a graduate student at CMU supervised by Rachel Mandelbaum has been working on image simulation and shape measurement analysis. He is partially supported by our SIT.

\subsection{Participation to the Tri-agency  Cosmological Simulation Task Force (TACS)}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The computational resources required to produce all of the cosmological simulations required for WFIRST are not yet well defined but they are known to be significant. WFIRST shares common goals with other upcoming cosmological surveys including LSST, Euclid, and DESI, so it makes sense to try to coordinate efforts between these projects. Team members have taken leadership position in articulating and leading this effort.

Team members Kiessling and Heitmann have been asked to co-chair a Tri-Agency Cosmological Simulations (TACS) task force at the request of the Project leads from WFIRST, LSST, and Euclid. The co-chairs have formulated a charge for TACS that has been approved by the Tri-Agency (NASA, DOE, NSF), Tri-Project (WFIRST, LSST, Euclid) group (TAG). TAG has representation from each of the Agencies and Projects and is responsible for the coordination of joint data processing and cosmological simulations for the three Projects. JPL WFIRST Project Scientist Rhodes represents the WFIRST and Euclid Projects on the TAG and Program Scientist Benford represents NASA for WFIRST. TACS consists of the two chairs, 9 task force members, and an advisory board of 7 people, with representation from WFIRST on the task force, advisory board, and from both of the co-chairs. The primary goal of TACS is to investigate areas for coordination between WFIRST, LSST, Euclid, and DESI of supercomputing resources, supercomputing infrastructure, cosmological simulations, synthetic sky generation, systematics investigation, and workforce personnel. TACS will report their recommendations directly to TAG and the reports will be made public for transparency. The responsibility for implementing and recommendations or negotiating MOUs lies with the TAG. Work is currently ramping up in TACS and is anticipated to extend into FY18.

\subsection{Community Deliverables}
%----------------------------------

In addition to our work supporting the Project Office, we published our results in scientific journals and made them available on the arXiv. The following 10 scientific papers were published by our team members and motivated by our studies:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \CoLi chains
\item CANDEL Catalogs
\item Simulations from Shirley et al.  - We have released a code that calculates the interloper fraction (Wong, Pullen \& Ho) : a Python-based program that applies secondary line identification and photometric cuts to mock galaxy surveys, in order to simulate interloper identification.  We also have a module specifically designed to do WFIRST and predict interloper rates for WFIRST. \citet{Wong:2016eku}
