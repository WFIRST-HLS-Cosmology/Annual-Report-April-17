This repository hosts the .tex file that will be used to produce our annual report.
I use the same LaTeX templates as our proposal. We will update them as we progress.

I reused the cover we did not use for the proposal and we will update it wuth the new team members.

The main file (the file that should be compiled) is wfirst_sit_hls_cosmology_annual_report_april17.tex and the associated pdf is wfirst_sit_hls_cosmology_annual_report_april17.pdf .

To-do list:
* Update cover with all new team members
* Identify missing parts.
