Cosmic acceleration is the most surprising cosmological discovery in
many decades.  Even the least exotic explanation of this phenomenon
requires an energetically dominant component of the universe with
properties never previously seen in nature, pervading otherwise
empty space, with an energy density that is many orders of magnitude
higher than naive expectations. Testing and distinguishing among possible  explanations requires cosmological
measurements of extremely high precision that probe the full history of
cosmic expansion and structure growth.
This program is one of the defining objectives of the Wide-Field
Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST), as set forth in the {\it New Worlds, New Horizons} 
report (NWNH) \cite{NWNH2010}.  The WFIRST-AFTA mission, as described in the Science
Definition Team (SDT) reports \citep[hereafter SDT13 and SDT15 respectively]{Spergel2013, Spergel2015}, has the ability to improve these
measurements by $1-2$ orders of magnitude compared to the current
state of the art, while simultaneously extending their redshift grasp,
greatly improving control of systematic effects, and taking a unified
approach to multiple probes that provide complementary physical information
and cross-checks of cosmological results.

We have assembled a team with the expertise and commitment needed to address the
stringent challenges of the WFIRST dark energy (DE) program through
the Project's formulation phase.  After careful consideration, we
have elected to address investigations A (Galaxy Redshift Survey, GRS) and
C (Weak Lensing (WL) and Cluster Growth (CL)) of the WFIRST Science
Investigation Team (SIT) NASA Research Announcement (NRA) with a
unified team, because the two investigations are tightly linked 
at both the technical level and the theoretical modeling level.
The imaging and spectroscopic elements of the High Latitude Survey (HLS)
will be realized as an integrated observing program, and they jointly
impose requirements on instrument and telescope performance, operations,
and data transfer.  The methods for simulating and interpreting
weak lensing and galaxy clustering observations largely overlap,
and many members of our team have expertise in both areas.
The WFIRST supernova cosmology program (investigation B) is more
distinct in its methods and requirements, so it is feasible to
integrate the supernova and HLS investigations at the level of the
Formulation Science Working Group (FSWG).

The team PI, Olivier Dor\'e, is a cosmologist with broad expertise in
cosmic microwave background and large scale structure (LSS) studies. He brings 
extensive experience with complex data analysis (e.g., the Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), Planck) and mission design (e.g.,
Joint Dark Energy Mission (JDEM) Destiny and the 
SMall EXplorer (SMEX) concept SPHEREx currently
under Phase A study, for which he is the Project Scientist). Yun Wang
and Chris Hirata will serve as Lead Co-Investigators for topics A and C,
respectively and David Weinberg will serve as Lead for sub-topic
``Cluster growth'' within topic C.  Many members of our team have been involved with the
design and requirements of a dark energy space mission for a decade or
more, including the Co-Chair (Spergel) and four additional members
(Hirata, Hudson, Wang, Weinberg) of the 2013-2015 WFIRST-AFTA SDTs.  Our team
includes authors of the two most comprehensive reviews of observational
methods for probing dark energy \cite{Wang2010, Weinberg2013} and the
Chair and Vice-Chair (Spergel, Weinberg) of the Astro2010 Science
Frontier Panel on Cosmology and Fundamental Physics, whose report played
a central role in the NWNH recommendation of WFIRST as the highest
priority large space-based program.  Our team of Co-Is includes world
leading experts on image processing and weak lensing (Eifler, Jain,
Jarvis, Kiessling, Lupton, Hirata, Mandelbaum), on design and 
analysis of galaxy redshift surveys (Ho, Padmanabhan, Samushia, Wang, Weinberg), 
on
space-based slitless spectroscopy analogous to that planned for WFIRST
(Teplitz), on photometric calibration (Padmanabhan), on photometric
redshifts (Capak) from large imaging surveys, and on cosmological forecasting
and parameter estimation from combinations of cosmic microwave
background (CMB), WL, and LSS data (Bean, Dor\'e, Eifler,
Hirata, Ho, Jain, Mandelbaum, Samushia, Spergel, Wang, Weinberg).

 This team of Co-Is brings close connections to most of the 
major current or planned cosmological experiments that will provide 
the context for the WFIRST dark energy program. This includes the WMAP and Planck CMB missions,
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), the Dark Energy Survey (DES),
the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) and Prime Focus Spectrograph (PFS)
projects, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the
Euclid mission and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) Dark
Energy Science Collaboration (DESC). Our team of U.S. and
international collaborators brings extensive expertise in detector
characterization, cosmological simulations, detailed simulations of
observational data sets, and the theoretical modeling and cosmological
interpretation of weak lensing and galaxy clustering data. 
Notably, members of our team are responsible for nearly all of the tables
and figures in \S\S\ 2.2.3-2.2.5 of the SDT15 report, describing the
HLS dark energy program.  We therefore have an unparalleled understanding
of the current design of WFIRST-AFTA and of the
challenges ahead in achieving its science goals.

We have structured our planning and our proposal around the series of
deliverables described in \S \ref{sec:deliverables}.  Because development of requirements is at the core of our proposed
investigation, we present some broad aspects of our strategy in \S \ref{sec:reqt_philosophy}
before turning to a more detailed discussion of the WL and GRS program
elements in \S\S \ref{sec:wl_gal-clusters} and \ref{sec:gc}.  We address questions of survey operations 
and optimization in \S \ref{sec:operation} and our plans for broad
community engagement in \S \ref{sec:engagement}. We conclude with our
management plan in \S \ref{sec:mgt}, re-emphasizing the value of a
unified approach to the HLS dark energy science program.
